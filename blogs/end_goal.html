                    With second year coming to a halfway point, I'm reflecting upon my life. Some of my friends are taking summer classes and using their transfer credits to graduate early.
                    For them, since third year will be their last year of university, they need to start thinking soon about what they're gonna do after they graduate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even though I still have two and a half more years before I graduate, this thought still haunts me. What am I gonna do with my life?
                </p>

                    Personally, I would prefer to start working right after I graduate. I might do a Master's degree, but only after already working for a few years.
                    I believe that it would be best for me to seek for some experience as soon as possible so that I can get a better sense of direction in what I enjoy in life.

                    I also think that in the long term I will go back to Thailand. I can't live in Toronto in the long term and I do think that Thailand is the best place to live in the world.
                    My friends and family are all in Thailand and I need to go back to them. Furthermore, Thailand has good food, standard of living, cost of living and would make me feel comfortable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With that out of the way, the question remains, what sort of work am I gonna do? This question remains a mystery to me.
                </p>

                    I have a lot of possible options of fields I can possibly go into. It's not like I feel like my options are limited.
                    Rather, I feel like my options are somewhat unclear and unsatisfactory. I don't necessarily have a dream job, but I do have some dream job conditions.
                    For example, I would like to work a job that provides value to the world. I would also like to work a job that gives me the creative freedom to do things how I like.
                    This means that I would like my job to be interesting and not boring and mundane. I don't need the highest paying job out there but I do want to be able to support myself financially. 
                    I also would like to interact with others in my life and not just stay in my own corner of the world the whole time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even though this narrows my options down quite a bit, I still couldn't really tell what exactly I want to do.
                    But that's ok; as long as I keep learning new valuable skills, it'll benefit me later down the line. 
                    So even if I don't know what I want to do, I might as well make sure that I'm prepared with the necessary skills when I do.
