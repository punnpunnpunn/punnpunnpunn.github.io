                    Writing's not usually my thing. I've really hated writing for most of my life.
                    I would personally say that I'm really bad at writing. I think I have some good ideas,
                    but when it reaches the paper (or the keyboard) my ideas are very poorly expressed.
                    I've always preferred speaking to writing. I feel like I am able to get my point across much better through speaking.
                    With that said, I fully acknowledge that writing is a really integral skill to have.
                    Being able to express your ideas out in a thorough manner, whether through speaking or writing, is critical.
                    The problem is that writing has never been enjoyable for me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Writing always seems like such a daunting task.
                    First, you have to think about what you're going to write about.
                    Then, you have to organize your thoughts and find good eloquent words to describe those thoughts.
                    Then, if you're anything like me, you have to google what words like daunting and eloquent even mean.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The thing is, I want to get better at writing. 
                    I'm bad at it right now but that doesn't mean I couldn't improve my writing skills.
                    If I gave myself a purpose to do it, I'll have the motivation to write and I'll get some practice in. 
                    Then, I can slowly get better at writing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've recently started my own personal website. It's the one you're on right now if you're reading this blog post.
                    I believe that starting my own website would be a good way to practice my programming skills and learn web design.
                    And what better thing to put on my website than some blog posts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I plan to use my blog posts as kind of a diary. I'll write about things I've learned in life and interesting interactions.
                    Unlike a diary, however, I will not be writing everyday, just every so often when I feel like I have something to share.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also I don't plan on making my writing perfect in these blog posts.
                    I'll try my best to write well, but I'm not pressuring myself to perfection.
                    This will just be something that I do in my pass time.
                    It'll just be a low pressure yet motivating way for me to practice writing. 
                </p>

                    Finally, before I end my first blog, I'd like to give 2 shoutouts to people who have inspired me to do this.
                    The first person being my friend Max Djaya. Like me, Max is also a computer science student at the University of Toronto.
                    Max was the one who inspired me to start a personal website as he also has a <a href="https://jamdays.github.io/" target="_blank">personal website</a> of his own.
                    Throughout my first year at U of T, Max has been coming up with personal projects and putting them on his website.
                    He's very dedicated to making games to put on his website. Often times he would be working on his website a few days before an exam.
                </p>
                <p>    
                    The second shout out goes to my friend Boom. Initially, I didn't really know what I was going to put on my website.
                    I thought that I'd probably just put up a bunch random projects that I made on here. That was when I found out about <a href="https://www.asoc.blog/" target="_blank">Boom's blogs</a>.
                    Reading Boom's blogs have been really interesting to me as I get to learn more about his personal insights that I may never think about.
                    That was enough to inspire me to create some blog posts of my own.
                </p>
                <p>
                    (Also, definitely check out <a href="https://jamdays.github.io/" target="_blank">Max's website</a> and <a href="https://www.asoc.blog/" target="_blank">Boom's blogs</a>)
                </p>
                <p>P.S. I would've write a nice conclusion here if I were good at writing.</p>
