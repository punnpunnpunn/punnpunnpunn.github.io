                    Currently at the time of writing this blog, I am enjoying my time off for reading week, reflecting on how my year has been so far.
                    I am taking 6 classes this semester: CSS207 (Software Design), CSC236 (Theory of Computation), MAT237 (Multivariable Calculus), 
                    MAT244 (Ordinary Differential Equations), ECO206 (Microeconomic Theory), and STA257 (Probability and Statistics).
                </p>
                <p>
                    I really enjoy my classes this year. I get to dive deeper into calculus in my multivariable calculus course and apply what I learned in my econ and stats class.
                    My CS courses are giving me interesting things to think about and interesting projects to make. ODEs, although a little too easy, is also still somewhat interesting of a course.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm slowly coming to realize that although I do enjoy mathematics, I also enjoy applying it. Pure maths is cool as an observer, but trying to write proofs everyday can get really tiring.
                    Applied math, on the other hand, is beautiful in its own way as you can see how all these different abstract concepts we learn in class can be applied to real life. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    My classes are pretty managable this year with the right difficulty for it to be interesting but not too tough.
                    Moving forward, I would like to learn more about Economics and do more CS projects.

                    Ok I know this is a weird way to end a blog but I don't know what else to write and I got work to do so short blog today.
